        <p div class="pipe"> My name is idiatou diallo I was born in 1996
        in Guinea west africa. I grew up there with my siblings and  went to schoool,
         I studied french and some english after I graduated I moved to the usa
        whit my brothers , we  first stayed in new york then we moved to chicago. <br>

        <br>chicago is a great city I love everything about chicago except the weather ,
            because it is very imprevisible and it snown alot. chicago is also know as the windy city .
            I also enjoy the lake during the summer time, and I go out of town for different activities with family. <br>
        
        <br>Chicago is very different to my home country not only the weather but the people too.
            there is more than 8 tribes who speaks different language but me I only speak one local language 
            because of the erea I grow.
